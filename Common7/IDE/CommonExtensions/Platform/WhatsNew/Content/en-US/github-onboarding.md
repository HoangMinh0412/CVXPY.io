Do you need to work with GitHub resources? Adding your GitHub account is now easier than ever! 

### New ways to sign in with your GitHub account

You are now able to sign in with your GitHub account during the first launch configuration dialog:

![GitHub sign in from the VS first launch dialog](../media/github-firstlaunch.png)

If you decide to skip the first launch account setting, you can also sign in straight from the VS shell without the need to first add a Microsoft account.

Please note that you won't be able to sync your settings until you add a Microsoft (work or school or personal) account to Visual Studio.
