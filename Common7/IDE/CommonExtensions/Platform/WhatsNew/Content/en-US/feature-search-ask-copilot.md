Ever find yourself needing to locate a specific menu item, command, or option in Visual Studio, but you don't know its name or location? Would you benefit from more details on how to use it properly?

Now, in [Feature Search](vscmd://Window.QuickLaunch), you can send your query to Copilot Chat to get a detailed response. If you're unsure of the specific terminology for a feature, Copilot Chat can interpret the semantic meaning of your query, consider your Visual Studio version, and provide an answer without having to leave the IDE.

For example, searching for 'prettify file' in Feature Search today won't surface the correct setting 'format document'. But Copilot Chat can identify and explain the relevant items in Visual Studio.

If your Copilot subscription is set up in Visual Studio, you can simply start typing your search into [Feature Search](vscmd://Window.QuickLaunch) and then click the **Ask Copilot** button to send it to chat. 

This integration streamlines your workflow by providing immediate, context-aware assistance directly within the IDE.
