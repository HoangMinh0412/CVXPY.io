Have you ever found yourself adding too much code to a *.razor* file and wanted an easy way to move it to its own reusable component? When working with HTML in a Razor file, you can now use `CTRL+.` or right-click and select **Quick Actions and Refactorings** to automatically extract your selected HTML markup to a new Razor component in Visual Studio.

In this first iteration, the *Extract element to new component* feature is only supported with HTML markup selections.

This enhancement streamlines your workflow by allowing you to modularize your Razor components effortlessly.
