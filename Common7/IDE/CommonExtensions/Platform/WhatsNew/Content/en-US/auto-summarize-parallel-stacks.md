When using Copilot in Visual Studio, you'll see a new AI-generated summary row at the top of each thread in the **Parallel Stacks** window. These summaries provide a high-level overview of each thread's current activity, helping you quickly grasp their purpose and status.  

This feature is designed to save you time and effort by presenting essential thread information in an intuitive, readable format, enabling you to focus on solving problems rather than untangling complex thread structures.  

Try it today and experience streamlined debugging with the latest AI-powered tools in Visual Studio!
