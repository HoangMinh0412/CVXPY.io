The Visual Studio profiler now enhances debugging for .NET applications by displaying stitched async stacks in both the summary and detail call tree views.

![Profiler's Unified Async Stacks](../media/profilers-async-stack.png)

This feature provides a clearer, more cohesive view of asynchronous operations, allowing developers to trace the full execution flow, including asynchronous method calls, all within a single, unified stack trace.

By eliminating the need to manually piece together separate async call paths, this improvement helps you quickly identify performance bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues more efficiently.
