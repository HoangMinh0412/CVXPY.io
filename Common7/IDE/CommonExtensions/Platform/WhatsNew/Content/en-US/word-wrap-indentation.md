We are excited to introduce a new feature that allows you to control whether wrapped lines are indented in the editor. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and customization for your coding environment, ensuring that your code appears exactly as you prefer.

To change this option, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Tools > Options > Text Editor > General**.
2. Look for the option called **Automatically indent when word wrap is enabled**.

By default, this option is enabled, meaning that wrapped lines will be indented. If you prefer your wrapped lines not to be indented, simply uncheck this option. This setting can help improve readability and maintain the desired formatting of your code, especially in projects where indentation style is crucial.

We hope this new feature enhances your productivity and makes your coding experience more enjoyable.
