Copilot in Visual Studio now helps you refine your code with Copilot Edits, a feature designed to make iteration across multiple files more efficient.

Start by clicking the button to create an Edits thread at the top of the Copilot Chat panel.

Copilot Edits combines the conversational flow of chat with an inline review experience to help developers:

1. **Preview with clarity**: Copilot Edits starts with a summary of the files affected and the proposed changes, so you know exactly what's happening.
2. **Review with flow**: View code diffs inline, directly in your editor. Accept or reject individual changes using the `TAB` or `Alt+Del` keys, or apply/dismiss all at once.
3. **Iterate with confidence**: Checkpoints let you revisit earlier iterations of a code file or try a different approach whenever you need toâ€”perfect for when inspiration strikes again.

Get started by describing the changes you'd like in natural language, and reference specific files, errors, or your solution using the # key, just as you already do in Copilot Chat.
