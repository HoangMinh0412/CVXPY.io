We are excited to introduce a new launch configuration option called `DependencyAwareStart`. When set to `True`, this option changes how Docker Compose projects are launched, enabling the use of the `depends_on` directive in your Compose configuration.

This feature ensures that specified containers are started in the correct order, adhering to the dependency requirements defined in your Docker Compose file. By managing dependencies more effectively, it enhances the robustness and reliability of multi-container applications.
