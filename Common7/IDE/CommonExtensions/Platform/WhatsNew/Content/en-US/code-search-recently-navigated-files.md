We're making it even easier to navigate around your codebase. 

Now, when you open [Code Search](vscmd://Edit.NavigateTo) without a query, you'll see a list of your recently navigated files. These include the files you opened through Code Search, but also any other files you opened in the solution. This makes it easy to jump back to a file you were recently working on without having to remember or type the file name.
