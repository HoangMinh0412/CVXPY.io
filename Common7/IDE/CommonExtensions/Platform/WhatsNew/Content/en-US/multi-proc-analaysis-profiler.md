The Visual Studio profiler's CPU Usage tool now supports multiprocess analysis, displaying performance graphs with distinct color coding for each process in swim lanes.

The graphs are displayed as stacked area charts. You also have the option to filter processes using a dropdown on the top left, enabling focused analysis.

This improvement allows you to easily distinguish and analyze CPU utilization across processes within a single session. By providing clearer insights into resource consumption, it enhances profiling efficiency and streamlines performance optimization for multiprocess applications.
