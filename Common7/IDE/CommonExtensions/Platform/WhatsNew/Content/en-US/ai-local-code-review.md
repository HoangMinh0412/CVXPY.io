Now, you can get a GitHub Copilot code review on your local changes before you even commit! With your Copilot subscription enabled in Visual Studio and the following feature flags enabled, you can see the new sparkle comment button in the Git Changes window. When clicked, Copilot will examine your sets of changes and propose some suggestions inline in your editor.

The model can point out critical issues such as potential performance and security problems that, when caught early, help reduce your risk of pushing issues into your remote code base.
